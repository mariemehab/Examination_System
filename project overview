Overview
The Examination System Database is a comprehensive solution developed to streamline the exam management process for educational institutions. It automates the storage, organization, and retrieval of data related to courses, exams, questions, student submissions, and results evaluation.

This database supports a range of features, including:

Managing student and instructor information.
Organizing courses and academic tracks.
Creating, storing, and retrieving exam questions.
Recording student responses to exam questions.
Calculating and storing exam results.
The project was developed as part of the Microsoft Data Engineer track during my training with the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI).
